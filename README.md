# Yelp Demo
====

Time spent: 30 hours and counting.

Completed user stories:
* [x] Search result page
* [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
* [x] Optional: Implement map view of restaurant results
* [x] Filter page
* [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states
* [x] Pods: AFNetworking, MBProgressHUD, BDBOAuth1Manager, Google-Maps-iOS-SDK

Notes:
Spent too much time on the Infinite scrolling (optional) and then spent too much time on the Map View, when I found it that the Yelp api does not return lat & long for each business.
For that reason when I got to the Filter Page it was too late.
